# playground
This repo aims to automate grunt work so that you can start "playing" write away.

This repo doesn't aim to be a bootstrapper of new projects.

Usually the aim is to setup things locally on *nix environments.

Currently there is [python/poetry](./python/poetry) to get you going for quick python virtualenv.

There are also other repos that I use for similar purposes:
- [playground-infra](https://github.com/ryuheechul/playground-infra)
- [playground-actions](https://github.com/ryuheechul/playground-actions)
- [playground-circleci](https://github.com/ryuheechul/playground-circleci)
